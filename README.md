# Polars Presentation
This repository contains resources related to a presentation about Polars - a high-performance DataFrame library implemented in Rust and backed by Apache Arrow.

## About Polars
Polars is an efficient open-source DataFrame library in Rust. Polars is designed to handle large data sets with a focus on performance. It uses lazy computation and is backed by Apache Arrow, which offers columnar storage resulting in memory-efficient and fast computations.

This presentation is based on @ritchie46's work and presentations about Polars. You can find his work here:
